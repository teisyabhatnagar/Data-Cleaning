This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that walk through core data cleaning and manipulation techniques in Python using pandas. Using real-world style datasets (NBA players, James Bond movies, and custom sales tables), it covers creating DataFrames, working with Series, grouping and aggregating, sorting values, handling missing data, splitting and transforming columns, and engineering new features to make raw data analysis-ready.
